## About Me
As an engineer, I aspire to make the world a smarter, healthier, and more connected place. Currently, I am working as a **Hardware Engineer** at **Entrust**, an organization that enables trusted identities, secure payments, and data protection globally. I recently completed my BEng degree in **Electrical and Electronic Engineering** at the **University of Manchester**, where I developed skills including hardware design, programming, and team leadership.

Some of my recent projects and achievements include:
- Working in the **Micro-LED Test Team** at **Meta Platforms** to build and qualify a far-field, wafer-level beam profile measurement system to support the development of next-generation AR and VR displays. *(Python, Matplotlib, NumPy, PyVISA, SciPy, SeaBreeze)*
- Leading the **Electronics and Software Team** at **Hyperloop Manchester**, a student-led engineering project with 80+ members, to research futuristic transport technologies and develop pod prototypes. *(C, C++, PlatformIO, Teensy 4.1)*
- Collaborating with **Sony** and **Texas Instruments** to deploy a field-portable embedded system to measure sea ice thickness and environmental conditions in the Arctic for my final year individual project. *(Arduino, C++, I2C, Spresense)*

Please feel free to connect and reach out about anything interesting related to **engineering**, **innovation**, or **technology**!
