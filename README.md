## About Me
As an engineer, I aspire to make the world a smarter, healthier, and more connected place. Currently, I am in my final year of the BEng programme in **Electrical and Electronic Engineering** at the **University of Manchester**, where I have developed skills including hardware design, programming, signal progressing, and team leadership.

Some of my recent projects and achievements include:
- Interning at **Meta**, within the MicroLED Test Team at **Reality Labs**, to build and qualify a far-field, wafer-level beam profile measurement system to support the development of next-generation AR and VR displays

- Managing eight people as the **Head of Electronics** at **Hyperloop Manchester**, a student-led engineering project with 80+ members, to research and develop a high-speed maglev pod for international competitions

- Collaborating with **Sony Corporation** and **Texas Instruments** to design and create a field-portable sensor platform to measure sea ice thickness in polar regions as a part of my final year individual thesis project

I am currently seeking a **graduate role** commencing in **2023**, so please feel free to connect and reach out about any interesting opportunities in engineering or technology!
